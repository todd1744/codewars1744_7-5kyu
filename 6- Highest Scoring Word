Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

def high(x):
    maxmary, ans = 0, ''
    for word in x.split():
        cmary = 0
        for c in word:
            cmary += ord(c) - 96
        if maxmary < cmary:
            maxmary = cmary      
            ans =  word
    return ans
    
# also

def high(x):
    return max(x.split(), key=lambda k: sum(ord(c) - 96 for c in k))
