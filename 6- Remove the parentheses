In this kata you are given a string for example:

"example(unwanted thing)example"
Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as the parentheses themselves.

The example above would return:

"exampleexample"
Notes
Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string. Don't worry about other brackets like "[]" and "{}" as these will never appear.
There can be multiple parentheses.
The parentheses can be nested.

    ss = ''
    count = 0
    k = 0
    prev = None
    for i, v in enumerate(s):
        if v == '(':
            if prev != v:
                ss += s[k:i]
                prev = v
            count += 1
        if v == ')':
            count -=1
            if count == 0:
                prev = None
                k = i + 1
    ss = ss + s[k:]
    return ss
